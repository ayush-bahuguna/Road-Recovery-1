//About Project

### Problem statement :

- We came up with the problem that most of us face in our day to day life, on daily bases we encounter pits and unmaintained roads around the city. The conditions of the roads are a problem and the process of reporting the problem is long and tedious and most of us donâ€™t consider going to such extends.

### Solution :

- A web application which provides easy complaint system for the user.
- Through the application, an individual will take snapshot of road using the application.
- Then the user will submit the picture. Along with the picture he will be asked for his name and location.
- Then all the queries and complaints will go the higher authority where it will be sorted in the order of most complaints from a given location.
- Then the higher authority will approve the query with maximum complaint in the given location for construction maintenance.
